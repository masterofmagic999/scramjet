# AES-256-GCM key for the server-side cookie store (file-based mode only).
# Set any non-empty string; the actual key is derived with scrypt internally.
# Leave unset to disable encryption (cookies stored as plain JSON).
# Not used when Appwrite is configured.

# ── Appwrite backend (optional but recommended for persistent sessions) ────────
# When APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID and APPWRITE_API_KEY are set, cookies are stored
# in Appwrite instead of a local JSON file.  This means:
#   • Sessions survive Codespace restarts automatically.
#   • Memory usage stays flat – no cookie data is held in the Node.js heap.
#
# Setup (one-time):
#   1. Create a free account at https://cloud.appwrite.io
#   2. Create a new project (any name).
#   3. In your project, go to Databases → create or open database
#      with ID: 6998bda1003d071c37b6
#   4. Create a collection with ID: parastar and these string attributes:
#        user_id    (String, required, size 36)
#        cookies    (String, required, size 1000000)
#        updated_at (DateTime, required)
#   5. Go to Settings → API Keys → Create API Key.
#      Grant at minimum: databases.read, databases.write, documents.*
#   6. Copy the Project ID from your project's Settings → General.
